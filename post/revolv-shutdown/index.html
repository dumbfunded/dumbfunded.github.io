  <div class="title"><h1><a href="/post/revolv-shutdown/">Revolv Shutdown</a></h1></div>

  <div class="caption"><p><img src="https://dumbfunded.imgix.net/revolv.jpg?w=640&amp;auto=format&amp;q=90" alt="Revolv in happier times" title="The Revolv family in happier times. No one could have predicted they would all be dead within two years." /></p>

<p><strong>Revolv</strong> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/revolv">(VC: $7.3mm)</a> made a dingus to smarten up your home. I guess it turned your lights on when you
told it to with your phone, but nobody is really sure. Nest bought them back in October 2014 and discontinued said dingus with a quickness, but kept its cloud
service running. As of May 15 2016 the free ride is over.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong> First of all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609233637/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.revolv.android.app&amp;hl=en">no
one</a> bought this thing. It also hasn&rsquo;t
been sold in 18 months and Nest clearly viewed it as an evolutionary dead end. The fact that Revolv was acqui-shutdowned by Nest pretty much says everything
there is to say about the success of their product.</p>

<p><strong>How much notice?</strong> 45 days. I mean, it&rsquo;s just the thing that (hypothetically) controls your entire house so that shouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal right? Nest is
trying to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/whats-going-on-at-nest-2016-2">get sold</a> or <a href="http://recode.net/2016/03/30/nest-2015-sales-budget/">shutdown</a>
themselves you know, they don&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/7/11378904/nest-tony-fadell-struggling">have all day</a> for this.</p>

<p><strong>How screwed are customers?</strong> If someone bought said dingus (which included a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/revolv-smart-home-hubs-lifetime-subscription-bricked-nest-google-alphabet-internet-of-things-2016-4">lifetime
subscription</a>, where by
lifetime they actually meant the length of time a Nest product manager&rsquo;s political capital could be drained to sustain the service) right before it was pulled
from shelves, they wound up paying $17 per month for it. For just the price of <a href="http://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/starbucks-prices/">9 cups of coffee</a> each
month, this ugly red tupperware container / irregular tortilla holder was yours to keep. And once it&rsquo;s useful Internet-of-Dumb-Things lifespan is over, it has
a long second life ahead of it as a paperweight or cautionary reminder of the fickleness of The Cloud.</p>

<p><strong>How do people feel about it?</strong> Pretty safe to say <a href="https://medium.com/@arlogilbert/the-time-that-tony-fadell-sold-me-a-container-of-hummus-cb0941c762c1">people
care</a> more about the death of Revolv than they ever
cared about it during its life.</p>

<p><strong>Was the phrase &lsquo;Incredible Journey&rsquo; used?</strong> No, but <a href="http://www.revolv.com/">the sentiment</a> is clearly there. The thing you liked &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t perfect&rdquo;, the team
has gone on to make something &ldquo;flat-out better&rdquo;, and most importantly shutting down is only &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo;. The beginning, perhaps, of a new and even more
incredible journey?</p>
